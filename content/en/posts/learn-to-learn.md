**Objective:** Recommend study content to help you learn how to learn.

Working in the tech field means constant learning. Many people feel intimidated
by this, especially because the way to study is not taught in schools or
universities. This makes learning a new subject daunting. Moreover, without a
proper study methodology, people waste time persisting with study methods that
can end up being more frustrating than productive.

## 1. Coursera

A course that really helped me not only recognize this problem but also solve it
was "Learning How to Learn: Powerful Mental Tools to Help You Master Tough
Subjects", available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/aprender).

I took it in 2017, and it’s still available today. The techniques I learned have
been incredibly helpful.

It was created by [Barbara Oakley](https://barbaraoakley.com/), Ph.D., a
professor of engineering at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, and
Ramón y Cajal.

## 2. Book

I enjoy reading about philosophy, and I was surprised by how much the book
"Filosofia a partir de seus problemas" by [Mário Ariel González Porta](ttp://lattes.cnpq.br/0864141297940508) helped me.

It teaches you to study philosophical works not only by trying to understand
their content and approach but by starting to see what motivated that work.
What was the context? What problem was the philosopher trying to solve?

Now, I apply that same question to what I study in technology. Why were [channels](https://go.dev/tour/concurrency/2)
invented? What problem does [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) solve?

If you're also interested in philosophy, the Escola do Parlamento (São Paulo
City Council) organized and made available an online course with the author
based on the book. You can access it [here](https://www.saopaulo.sp.leg.br/escoladoparlamento/cursos/cursos-anteriores/cursos-realizados-em-2020/a-filosofia-a-partir-de-seus-problemas/) (Portuguese only).
