My name is Amanda Hager Lopes de Andrade Katz. I am a software engineer focused
on infrastructure (is there a name for that?). A mix of SRE, DevOps, Dev, and
coffee.

I was born in São Caetano do Sul, São Paulo, Brazil.

I live with my husband, and together we love traveling the world!

In this blog, I want to share what I learn, what sparks my curiosity, and what I
recommend in the context of technology.
